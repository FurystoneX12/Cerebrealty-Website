# README

This project is supposed to be a website currently being improved to, you know, for you to feel convenient during your surf in this website.

And also, in case you didn't know, the owner of these codes is a child who will break your jaw, arms, neck, and legs if you ever modify this project, or just tweak some files, and save those bugs and push to this repository without his permission. :)
